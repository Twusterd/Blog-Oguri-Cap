        <h2 align="middle">About Oguri</h2>
        <P>Oguri Cap (Japanese : オグリキャップ, 27 March 1985 – 3 July 2010) was a Japanese thoroughbred racehorse and stud, sired by Dancing Cap. Oguri Cap was inducted into the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame in 1991. A horse from the countryside who found success at the national level, he was known as a member of the "Heisei Big Three", a trio of racehorses who reignited interest in Horse racing in Japan alongside Super Creek and Inari One.</P>
        <p>Oguri Cap had a major impact on the Japanese horse-racing scene, thanks in no small part to his humble beginnings.</p>
        <p>Due to starting his career in regional races, his move to the National scene came too late for him to be registered for the 1988 season of the Japanese Classic races, specifically the Satsuki Shō, the Tōkyō Yūshun (Japanese Derby) and the Kikuka Shō, collectively called the "Japanese Triple Crown". However, as Oguri Cap continued to win race after race, there was a popular outcry to allow him to participate in the classics despite missing the deadline. While the Japan Racing Association stood firm against allowing Oguri to participate, they did soon after change their rules to be less strict on registration, allowing late entries and even foreign-born horses to run in the classics, though with a hefty fee attached. One of the beneficiaries of this new rule was T M Opera O.</p>
        <p>Oguri Cap was extremely popular with fans, earning the nickname "Idol Horse", thanks to drawing crowds who watched the races for more than just race-betting, and was one of the first racehorses to have plush dolls made in his image, a form of merchandise that is now commonplace.</p>
<hr>
        <h2 align="middle">Racing Career</h2>
        <p>In May 1987, Oguri Cap made his debut at Kasamatsu Racecourse in Gifu Prefecture. After winning 9 starts in 11 races, including 7 consecutive victories and 4 stakes wins, he was transferred to the ownership of Chuo Horse Racing in January 1988. He recorded 13 more wins, including 4 Grade I stakes, 2 Grade II stakes, and 4 Grade III stakes. Some of his biggest wins included the 1989 Mile Championship (GI), two-time wins in the Arima Kinen (Grand Prix) (GI), and a win in the 1990 Yasuda Kinen (GI). He also won the New Zealand Trophy (GII), the Takamatsunomiya Hai (GII) and won the Mainichi Ōkan (GII) twice.</p>

            <blockquote>
        <q>The entire stands shook with cheers before the finish line, and I will never forget the thunderous Oguri call that followed, sung by 177,000 people. As a horse racing professional, I consider it a lifelong treasure to have been able to witness that moment.</q>

            </blockquote>
            
        <p>Oguri Cap was known for his rivalry with fellow gray-haired horse of the year Tamamo Cross, with whom he fought three times at the 1988 Tenno Sho (Autumn), Japan Cup, and Arima Kinen.</p>       
        <p>In 1988, Oguri Cap won the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Colt and in 1990, he won both the JRA Award for Best Older Male Horse and Japanese Horse of the Year. His nicknames included "Oguri" and the "Grey-Haired Monster".</p>

<hr>
        <h2 align="middle"> Retirement</h2>
        <p>After retirement in 1991, Oguri Cap was sent to the Yushun Stallion Station to stand stud. He was not able to produce any racers of his caliber, and in 2007 he was retired from stud duty. After retirement, he lived as a pensioned stallion at the Yushun Stallion Station. On July 3, 2010, he fractured one of the tibias in his legs in an apparent pasture accident, and was subsequently euthanized.</p>
        <p>Some of his notable progeny include:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>Osumi Bright (1995) - Winner of the 1998 NHK Mile Cup (GI)</li>
            <li>Osumi Hawkeye (1996) - Winner of the 2000 Kyoto Shimbun Hai (GII)</li>
            <li>Boldog Hos (1997) - Winner of the 2001 Keisei Hai (GIII)</li>
            <li>Air Dublin (1998) - Winner of the 2002 Keisei Hai (GIII)</li>
            <li>Osumi Prince (1999) - Winner of the 2003 Kyoto Shimbun Hai (GII)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While Oguri Cap's impact as a sire was not as significant as his racing career, he did produce several successful racehorses and contributed to the Japanese breeding industry.</p>
